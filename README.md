# About The Project
A Discord bot was developed to integrate essential dormitory services, including roll calls, leave requests, and repair reporting. The bot allows floor leaders and residents to access these functions directly within Discord, providing real-time data and improving communication. It simplifies dormitory management by automating processes that were previously manual, enhancing operational efficiency for both residents and administrators.
